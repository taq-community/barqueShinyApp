\usage{
write_selected_primer_csv(input_file, output_file, primer_to_activate)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_file}{Character. Path to the input CSV file with primer definitions.}

\item{output_file}{Character. Path to the output CSV file to write the modified data.}

\item{primer_to_activate}{Character. The exact name of the primer (first column value) to activate
(i.e., remove the `#` prefix from its line).}
}

}
\description{
This function processes a primer definition file where each entry line is commented out with a leading `#`.
It ensures all data lines begin with a `#` (normalization step), then activates a specific primer by removing
the `#` character from the line that matches the given primer name in the first column.
}
\details{
This function is useful for selecting a single active primer in workflows where only one
primer block should be used at a time. It preserves all other lines as commented, and the file
remains readable as a CSV after processing.
